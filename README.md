These are lecture notes for the graduate class 'Conformal Field Theory' held at the University of Bern in the Spring semester 2022.

Content
-------

- Introduction: What is CFT? Why is it useful. Examples of CFT. Where does it fit into modern theoretical physics.	(*Lecture 1*)
- Non-perturbative quantum field theory
- Spectral representation

- Conformal algebra

- Radial quantization, state-operator correspondence, and OPE


Other things to fit in:

- Renormalization; Wilson's definition of OPE (see Markus' notes?)
- Composite operators and anomalies?
- IR divergences? see di Francesco ex. 4.5
- action principle: energy-momentum tensors in free theories (exercise? canonical vs. Belinfante); compute dilatation current
- cluster decomposition of 4-point function (di Francesco ex. 5.2)
- Massless regularization of propagator in 2D; Bessel integral form of propagator, with IR and UV divergences



Philosophy
----------

different approach from most recent CFT course


Bibliography
------------

These notes are based on several standard reviews of conformal field theory:
- Slava Rychkov's [EPFL lectures on Conformal Field Theory in D>= 3 Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05000).
- David Simmons-Duffin's [TASI lectures on the conformal bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07982).

For the Lorentzian side:
- Slava Rychkov's IPhT course on [Lorentzian methods in conformal field theory](https://courses.ipht.fr/?q=en/node/226)

Technical but comprehensive review on the bootstrap:
- [The Conformal Bootstrap: Theory, Numerical Techniques, and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04405), by David Poland, Slava Rychkov and Alessandro Vichi.
- Shai Chester's [Weizmann Lectures on the Numerical Conformal Bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05147)

Older reviews:
- Paul Ginsparg' [Applied Conformal Field Theory lectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9108028)
- Joe Polchinski's String Theory books.
- Di Francesco, Mathieu and Sénéchal's [big yellow book of CFT](https://inspirehep.net/literature/454643)

Other courses:
- Hugh Osborn's [Lectures on Conformal Field Theories in more than two dimensions](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/ho/CFTNotes.pdf)
- Sylvain Ribault's [Conformal field theory on the plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4290v5), also available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ribault/CFT-Review)

In some sense, close in spirit to the "unparticle physics" series of papers by Howard Georgi:
