Content
-------

- Introduction: What is CFT? Why is it interesting. Examples of CFT.

- Non-perturbative quantum field theory and conformal symmetry: Wightman functions, spectral representation, Euclidean correlation functions, time-ordered products and path integrals
- Conformal correlators: embedding space formalism, 2-, 3- and 4-point function
- State-operator correspondence and OPE: radial and N-S quantizations, OPE convergence
- The conformal bootstrap: conformal blocks, numerical bootstrap, generalized free field theory, analytic bootstrap
