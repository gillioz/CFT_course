These are lecture notes for the graduate class 'Conformal Field Theory' held at the University of Bern in the Spring semester 2022.

Content
-------

- Introduction: What is CFT? Why is it interesting. Examples of CFT.
- Classical conformal invariance: Infinitesimal and finite transformation, conformal algebra, compactifications of space(-time), the energy-momentum tensor
- Non-perturbative quantum field theory and conformal symmetry: Wightman functions, spectral representation, Euclidean correlation functions, time-ordered products and path integrals
- Conformal correlators: embedding space formalism, 2-, 3- and 4-point function
- State-operator correspondence and OPE: radial and N-S quantizations, OPE convergence
- The conformal bootstrap: conformal blocks, numerical bootstrap, generalized free field theory, analytic bootstrap
- Selected advanced topics
