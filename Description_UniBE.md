Summary
-------

Conformal field theory (CFT) is an ubiquitous subject in modern theoretical physics. Every local quantum field theory approaches a CFT in the large- and small-distance limits, and even the study of quantum gravity is related to it through the AdS/CFT correspondence. CFT is also one of the rare frameworks in which quantum field theory can be studied outside the realm of perturbation theory.

This is an introductory course in which the students will learn what is conformal field theory, why it is special, and get a glimpse of modern developments. The course will begin with a non-perturbative formulation of quantum field theory (Wightman functions, spectral representation), and then gradually focus on understanding the implications of scale and special conformal symmetry. The study of practical tools (embedding space formalism, radial quantization, state-operator correspondence, conformal blocks) will finally lead to the formulation of the modern conformal bootstrap and a review of its most recent results. Some advanced topics will be discussed depending on the students' interests (Virasoro symmetry in 2 dimensions, UV and IR divergences, Mellin representation, superconformal symmetry).


Prerequisites
-------------

The only prerequisite for the course is basic knowledge of quantum field theory.
